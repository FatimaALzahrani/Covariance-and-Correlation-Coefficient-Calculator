## Overview

The **Covariance and Correlation Coefficient Calculator** is an interactive tool designed to help users understand the relationships between two variables using covariance and correlation. This tool allows users to calculate and visualize the strength and direction of relationships between datasets, while providing intuitive graphical representations like scatter plots and correlation annotations.

This project serves both educational and practical purposes by making it easier to interpret statistical data in various fields such as finance, healthcare, and engineering. The interactive elements help users see how different parameters like noise levels and slope impact the relationship between variables.

## Features

- **Covariance Calculation**: Measures the joint variability of two variables, showing how they change together.
- **Correlation Coefficient Calculation**: Computes the Pearson correlation coefficient, providing a dimensionless value between -1 and 1 that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship.
- **Scatter Plot Visualization**: Displays data points on a scatter plot with an option to add mean lines and correlation annotations.
- **Noise and Slope Adjustments**: Users can adjust noise levels and the slope of the data to observe how these factors affect covariance and correlation.
- **Random Data Generation**: Allows users to generate random datasets for practice and experimentation with the calculator.
